By dawid and piotrek

-HOW TO USE
- Left click to place sand, right click to place brick, middle click to place water, shift to delete block
- change variables in global folder, grid size automatically adjusts with the window size specified, pixel size will change the size of the pixels

-UNFINISHED: 
- plan to add more blocks, gui, advanced block placement and multithreading sorta

BUGS:
- blocks immediately teleport to the bottom of the screen (in the correct place tho), without falling each frame which is what I should expect
- sand doesn't sink under water even though it should in my code
-x- glitchy effects when trying to place blocks on already existing blocks FIXED, A BYPRODUCT OF THE FIRST BUG

piotrek if u can try to fix something would be appreciated, I can answer questions if not ok, I think the first bug is most important to fix
also to put it on GitHub or something cuz idk how
